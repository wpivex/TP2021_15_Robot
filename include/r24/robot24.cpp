// TODO: Implement the BaseRobot interface with the Robot24 class
// I recommend trying to go through all the refactoring I did to understand how it works, and also taking a look at what changed with the 15's codebase
// since it previously got decoupled from 24 

// Also, you'll want to rewrite any of your functions that "manually" implement trapezoidal in the 24 drive functions
// to use the new and improved TrapezoidController.cpp class. Make sure to read the documentation to understand exactly how the class works
